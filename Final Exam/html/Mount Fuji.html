                <p>Mt. Fuji is arguably the most perfect volcanic cone in existence and is often portrayed in art, literature, and religion. 
                    Unlike other famous high-elevation mountains in the world, Mt. Fuji is not part of a large mountain range. It stands alone, in all its magnificence.
                    Mt. Fuji's significance to Japan began with the Shinto religion who believed a deity lived in the crater. Pilgrimages were made to the summit and the crater in honor of the deity. 
                    As the pilgrimages started to grow in popularity, organizations began to support the increasing amount of travelers on the mountain. 
                    Trails were designated, mountain huts established, shrines built, and the rest is history. Along with Mt. 
                    Tate and Mt. Haku, Mt. Fuji is one of the three holiest mountains in the country. Today, Mt. Fuji is an important symbol in Japan and a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site. 
                    Its beauty is enjoyed by many people all around the world.
