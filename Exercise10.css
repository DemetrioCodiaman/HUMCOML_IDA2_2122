            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </header>
        <br>
        <p class="p1">Video gaming is a very popular leisure activity among adults (Pew Research Center, 2018). 
        The amount of time spent playing video games has increased steadily, from 5.1 h/week in 2011 to 6.5 h/week in 2017 (The Nielsen Company, 2017). 
        Video gaming is known to have some benefits such as improving focus, multitasking, and working memory, but it may also come with costs when it is used heavily. 
        By spending a predominant part of the day gaming, excessive video gamers are at risk of showing lower educational and career attainment, problems with peers, and lower social skills (Mihara and Higuchi, 2017). 
        On the one hand, video game use is widespread, and it may come with certain precursors as well as consequences. 
        On the other hand, little is known about the relations between various video gaming habits and psychological functioning. 
        This study aims to shed light on these important relations using a large sample.</p>

        <p class="p1">A video game is defined as “a game which we play thanks to an audiovisual apparatus and which can be based on a story” (Esposito, 2005). 
        In the last few years, the amount of scientific research devoted to video game playing has increased (e.g., Ferguson, 2015; Calvert et al., 2017; Hamari and Keronen, 2017). 
        Most scientific studies in this area of research have focused on the extent of video game play and its diverse correlates. 
        While some researchers have emphasized the benefits of game playing and even suggested a therapeutic use of video games 
        (Primack et al., 2012; Granic et al., 2014; Colder Carras et al., 2018), others have been intrigued by its potential dangers (Anderson et al., 2010; Müller and Wölfling, 2017).</p>

            <h2>Definition</h2>
        </header>
        <br>
        <p><p class="p2">The lack of any industry definition for a video game by 2021 was an issue during the case Epic Games v. 
            Apple which dealt with video games offered on Apple's iOS App Store. 
            Among concerns raised were games like Fortnite Creative and Roblox which created metaverses of interactive experiences, and whether the larger game and the individual experiences themselves were games or not in relation to fees that Apple charged for the App Store. 
            Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, recognizing that there was yet an industry standard definition for a video game, established for her ruling that "At a bare minimum, videogames appear to require some level of interactivity or involvement between the player and the medium" 
            compared to passive entertainment like film, music, and television, and "videogames are also generally graphically rendered or animated, as opposed to being recorded live or via motion capture as in films or television".
            Rogers still concluded that what is a video game "appears highly eclectic and diverse"</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
        </header>
        <br>
    <p><p class="p3">The early history of the video game industry, following the first game hardware releases and through 1983, had little structure. 
        While video games quickly took off, the newfound industry was mainly composed of game developers with little business experience, and led to numerous companies forming simply to create clones of popular games to try to capitalize on the market. 
        Due to loss of publishing control and oversaturation of the market, the North American market crashed in 1983, dropping from revenues of around $3 billion in 1983 to $100 million by 1985. 
        Many of the North American companies created in the prior years closed down. Japan's growing game industry was briefly shocked by this crash but had sufficient longevity to withstand the short-term effects, and Nintendo helped to revitalize the industry with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1985. 
        Along with it, Nintendo established a number of core industrial practices to prevent unlicensed game development and control game distribution on their platform, methods that continue to be used by console manufacturers today.</p>

        <p class="p3">The industry remained more conservative following the 1983 crash, forming around the concept of publisher-developer dichotomies, and by the 2000s, leading to the industry centralizing around low-risk, triple-A games and studios with large development budgets of at least $10 million or more. 
        The advent of the Internet brought digital distribution as a viable means to distribute games, and contributed to the growth of more riskier, experimental independent game development as an alternative to triple-A games in the late 2000s and which has continued to grow as a significant portion of the video game industry.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        </header>
        <br>
    <p><p class="p4">The current study adds to the knowledge on gaming by uncovering the specific relations between video gaming and distinct measures of psychological functioning. 
        Potentially problematic video gaming was found to be associated with positive affect and social relationships while playing but also with psychological symptoms, maladaptive coping strategies, negative affectivity, low self-esteem, a preference for solitude, and poor school performance. 
        Including gamers’ reasons for playing video games and their preferred game genres helped deepen the understanding of the specific and differential associations between video gaming and psychological health. 
        This knowledge might help developing adequate interventions that are applied prior to the occurrence of psychological impairments that may go along with potentially problematic video gaming.</p>
