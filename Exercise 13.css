                    League of Legends, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. 
                    Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.

        <b>Champion Counterplay</b>
        <br>
         Counterplay, one of our key values, could be defined as “action, choice, or strategy a player can use to mitigate or overcome an enemy threat.” 
         This has been a staple of our design philosophy for many years and has improved League time and time again when we apply it well. The two main benefits of this game design principle are:
         <br>
         <b>Fairness</b>
         <br>
         Having an understandable, clear, and useful response significantly reduces the frustration of a losing game or death even if a player or team can't perfectly execute on it at their current skill level. 
         It helps players grow by pointing them toward actions they could have taken to succeed, rather than just feel like the game cheated them. (This is also often referred to in game design as Agency.)
         <br>
         <b>Depth</b>
         <br>
         Champion designs that leave room for an opponent to respond add many additional layers to the depth of the experience. 
         Battles can be a back and forth of mechanical and mental skill instead of a “who shoots first” one-and-done experience.
